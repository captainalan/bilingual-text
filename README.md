# Simple Bilingual Translation Page

This website presents bilingual texts with hideable commentary in a
minimalistic, mobile and desktop friendly manner.

Data is read in via JSON. See a sample on [Github
Pages](https://captainalan.github.io/bilingual-text/).

## Other Notes

This project is made with vanilla JavaScript (ES6) and HTML. 

### Useful tools

Use node's [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) to ensure fetching JSON
works. From the root directory:

```
serve -d .
```

Navigating your browser to the appropriate url (e.g. http://localhost:5000) will
display the page.
